        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>These days, playing a quality video game (that has more than an hour of content and isn't filled with micro-transactions) costs a suprising amount. At least 200$ for a console, and then at least 30$ for each game (though indie games do give some relief in that regard). This means less people can have fun and be inspired by video games. <br><img align="middle" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/981670119002472470/981697197391380510/consoles.png" width="75%"><br> It is also astronmically hard to make a game of your own and put it on a console. We wish to allow people to exercise their creativity by creating experiences that they and others will enjoy. This leads to people getting demotiviated and causing a lack of creativity and ideas in gaming.</p>
